# 3D-Modelling-and-Animation

In this module I've learned the fundamentals of character and object animation using computer graphics, and how to model, texture and rig a 3D object as well as the fundamentals of animation and how objects and characters can move. 

As a assignment I had to rig and animate the popular Pixar lamp, into a 30 seconds video. I have used Cinema 4D to create this animation.
